# Yet Another Movies/TV Series Rating Scripts For Netflix iOS APP

These scripts will indicate the rating scores from *[IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)/[Douban](https://movie.douban.com)/[Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/)* on Netflix iOS, contained with two features: Overall Rating & Per Episode Rating.

This version is a modification of Yichahucha's brilliant work: https://github.com/yichahucha/surge/tree/master, I made some minimal layout and brought back ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¼ flag but the else are the same.

ðŸš¨ Some scores may be missing due to inapplicable data, outdated cookies or invalid api.

## Load'em in your *[Surge](https://community.nssurge.com/d/33-scripting)/[Quantumult X](https://github.com/crossutility/Quantumult-X/blob/master/sample.conf)* or build a Surge Module yourselves:
